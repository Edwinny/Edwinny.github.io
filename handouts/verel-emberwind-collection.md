## 📚 A Library of the Ages

You discovered Vaelithar is quite the hoarder of knowledge; especially when it comes to Verel Thule. You added a couple of verses to your collection

### I.

Before the song was broken, the sea sang to itself —

its waves the breath of gods unborn, its foam the dreams of men unmade.

But then came the hand that stilled the tide, and the silence learned to weep.

### II.

I have seen the sun drown its twin, and both give birth to shadow.

The sky remembers where the wound began, though none recall the blade.

Yet in the mirror’s shattered face, each shard still dreams of being whole.

### III.

They built their heavens from the bones of thought, and their hells from the dust of memory.

And I, a child of neither world, am cursed to dream the moments in between —

the breath before the world awoke, the tear that split the soul.

### IV.

Do not ask the name of the one who mends, for even he has forgotten the shape of mercy.

He gathers light in broken hands, and calls it home.

I have seen his shadow kneel beside the dawn —and whisper, not yet.
