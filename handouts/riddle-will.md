# A mysterious message in the wilds

Alleyana… I know you may not want to even listen to my voice, but this is my last message to you, so please bear with me.

First of all… I’m sorry.

I apologize for not understanding your dream. I opposed you because I was worried that your youthful talents would be squandered and you would be forced to settle into a comfortable but inferior life, like your parents.

I’m sorry for being so stubborn all the time.

If you are hearing this recording, you must have solved the mystery.

I believe that you have come this far because I deliberately wrote my will in such a way that would motivate you.

I hope the answer to the final riddle touched you.

Precious things are remembered only when they are obtained with difficulty.

Ever since you were little, you had trouble making genuine connections with anyone, and you were easily hurt.

I was worried about you. After I was gone… you would truly be an island. And your hard heart would calcify forever.

One of the great comforts of my life was knowing I had people in my life who understood me and loved me even when I was being, well, you know how I am.

Alleyana, my precious treasure…

You are a flower that overcame the bitterest season and still bloomed.

My love, I hope you find friends to stand beside you. A single flower is beautiful, but the garden is meant to be shared.

And I hope… you liked the riddle.

… But most of all, I hope your life is a happy
