# Grove of silent echoes

### 🌿 A Sacred Site Beneath Moonbrook

Hidden deep within a veil of glimmering mists at the edge of Moonbrook lies the **Grove of Silent Echoes**, one of the oldest and most hallowed places in the realm of the Spring Court. Though it appears as a resplendent wisteria encircled by silver-barked trees and ancient standing stones, the grove’s true significance is far more profound.

Beneath the surface, **a root of Yggdrasil—the World Tree—pierces through the Feywild here**, anchoring realms together in a tangle of divine, planar energy. The root is ancient beyond reckoning, predating even the Summer Court itself. Where it touches the land, **a natural convergence of fate, memory, and prophecy forms**, making the grove a powerful source of seelie magic and insight.

### ✨ The Echoes

In its prime, the Grove of Silent Echoes served as a place of meditation, vision quests, and counsel for the high fey. When one walked among the stones and listened to the stillness, **they would hear “echoes” of possible futures**, faint whispers of the World Tree’s memory. These echoes were never commands, but subtle glimpses—reflections of what might be. Only the most attuned could interpret them.

The roots of Yggdrasil also allowed souls to briefly commune across planes, guiding the departed or receiving messages from the distant past. The grove was **a sanctuary of balance**, and Moonbrook’s magic was closely tied to it.

### 🌫️ The Disturbance

But something has changed.

The waters of the grove’s central pool—fed by the dew of Yggdrasil’s root—have turned **clouded and still**. The echoing voices have fallen silent, replaced by a **heavy, watching stillness**, like holding your breath in a dream that never ends. Fey pilgrims speak of glimpsing **fractured reflections** in the water—images of themselves warped, changed, or corrupted.

Worse still, the grove’s guardian—an ancient dryad known as **[[Sylvara the Listening Root]]**—has vanished. No one has seen her in a tenday, and even sending magic cannot find her. **Something unnatural** is coiled around the root beneath the grove, leeching its clarity and silencing its visions.

Some whisper that this is a result of **a curse from the Shadowfell**, others blame a **disruption in the balance of the World Tree**, or even **meddling by a rogue Archfey** seeking to sever the root for power.

Whatever the cause, the sacred site must be restored.
