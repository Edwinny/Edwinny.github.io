# The Spring Court

The Realm of Change and Reflection

Once overshadowed by the mighty Summer and Winter Courts, Spring now blooms in their silence. A court of awakening, beauty, and endless change, it is a realm where art breathes and even reality can shift like sunlight through leaves.

## The Rulers: Inanna & Azena

The Spring Court is ruled not by one, but two ancient sovereigns:

- Inanna, Lady of Growth and Light. She embodies new life, thriving gardens, and the joy of creation. Her touch is warm as sunlight and restless as new rivers.
- Azena, Lady of Memory and Reflection. She shapes the past into new forms, weaving illusions and guarding the old stories. Her gaze is cool and thoughtful, like moonlight on glass.

Together, they are called the Verdant Crown, and their voices shape the Court’s future.

## Life in the Spring Court

- Beauty is Power: In Spring, creation is the highest art. Gardens, illusions, songs, and memories are all traded as currency of status. A song that makes fey weep may be more valuable than gold.
- Memories for Sale: Stories and memories can be bottled and exchanged in markets of silver and glass.
- Nothing Lasts Forever: Roles change. Names change. Even forms change. Growth and renewal are sacred, even when they are painful.
- Dreams Made Real: Illusions are not trickery here—they are life. Reflections and dreams often walk alongside you.
- The Mortal Touch: Mortals are viewed as unpredictable, but fascinating. Their presence may be welcomed… or collected

## Places You Might See

- Moonbrook, City of Reflections:  
   A city where canals shimmer like mirrors and towers reflect light in impossible ways. Ruled directly by Inanna and Azena, it is the heart of Spring’s ambition and mystery.
- The Mirror Marches:  
   Pools that reflect not faces, but memories. If you stare too long, you may lose yourself.
- The Fraying Paths:  
   A shifting labyrinth of vines and glass where lost things—and people—wander.
- The First Bloom:  
   A sacred glade where the first flower of Spring still blooms, untouched by time.
