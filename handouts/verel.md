**A fragmented recollection, attributed to the Dreaming Scribe of Verel Thule, circa the Age Before Echoes.**

_“There are those who speak of a being called Hades. Not a king, nor archfey, nor god—yet older than all three. A flicker in the myths of every age. Never seen, but always just behind the fall.”_

...

_“Some say he stood beside the last kings of Netheril as their towers turned to ash. Others claim he mourned beneath the first World Tree when its branches were torn from the One Realm and flung into the Feywild, the Shadowfell, and the waking world.”_

...

_“The Courts deny his existence. Scholars scoff. But I have found his name etched in silver, sung in forgotten dialects, painted in eyes that do not blink.”_

...

_“He walks. Not among us, but beside us. And if you meet him, you won’t know until the tale is already over.”_
