> Fragment II — From “On the Errors of Counting” (section missing)

\<_Handwritten except remains intact_\>

<br/>

one breaks into two

two pretend to be many

many insist they are alone

the thread knots itself and calls this fate

the knife says it is mercy

there is a city inside the frost

there is a frost inside the city

neither agrees

a voice without a mouth said: stand still

the stillness moved instead

if you are reading this

you are not where you think

if you are not reading this

good
