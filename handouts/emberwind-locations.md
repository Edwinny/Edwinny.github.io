# 🔥 Key Locations in Emberwind

## The Emberheat Plaza

At the city’s center lies a vast circular plaza paved with black volcanic stone shot through with glowing cracks. Braziers of ever-burning flame line the edges, while a colossal statue of a phoenix rises at its heart, wings unfurled, beak raised to the sky. The phoenix is hollow, its body filled with fire that flickers and shifts like a living soul.

This is where festivals, trials, and great announcements are held. Crowds often gather here at dawn and dusk to “listen” to the phoenix’s flames, said to carry whispers of the city’s ancestors

## The Smoldering Market

A sprawling bazaar filled with open flames and glowing forges. Here, smiths, glassblowers, and cooks all work in plain sight, turning raw material into craft and cuisine before your eyes. Spices sizzle as merchants toss them into pans, molten glass is spun into shimmering orbs, and performers breathe fire to punctuate their songs

The market is chaotic, loud, and overwhelming—but it is also the heart of Emberwind’s commerce and culture, where every deal feels like it was sealed with a spark.

## The Ashen Gardens (Seed-Planting Site)

Tucked between the fiery plazas and roaring forges lies a quiet, hallowed space: the Ashen Gardens. Once, this land bloomed with flowering groves, but during the Hollow War this quarter of the city was reduced to ruin in a single night of unchecked magic and fire.

In the Gardens’ heart stands a great stone basin of cooled volcanic glass, cracked and waiting.

The people of Emberwind leave offerings here—charred wood, ashes of their dead, fragments of broken tools—symbols of what has been lost. Yet it is also a place of hope: children often plant small flowers or herbs among the ash, knowing few will grow but cherishing those that do.

It is here the Great Banyan Seeds are destined to be planted. Their roots will weave into the old scars of the Hollow War, turning memory of destruction into a symbol of renewal for all the Spring Court.

## The Crimson Spire

A flame-lit tower of obsidian and brass where Emberwind’s leaders and fire-mages gather. Its windows glow with heat and light at all hours, and it is said that from its uppermost balcony one can see fiery veins of the Feywild stretching for miles beneath the earth.
