# Campaign Pitch

“In the City of Reflections, truth lies in what you don’t see.”

The great Summer and Winter Courts—once the pillars of Feywild power—have fallen ominously silent. In their absence, the Spring and Autumn Courts rise, their influence blooming like new growth… and creeping like ivy.

At the heart of the Spring Court, stands Moonbrook—a city where dreams take shape and memories walk. Ruled in delicate harmony by Azena and Inanna, this Feywild metropolis is a sanctuary of art, magic, and mystery.

You find yourselves in the employ of these sovereigns, new to the role; and enjoying the trappings of power that come with the station.

In a realm where reality shifts like silk, and even your past may not belong to you, will you find the truth beneath the surface?

## Tone & Themes

- Shifting alliances in a Seelie Court that values beauty over honesty.
- Interwoven subplots: corrupted guardians, lost reflections, and ancient bargains.

- Tower of God
