> Fragment from the Thirteenth Book of Unkept Hours — Verel Thule

When Winter loved Spring too fiercely, she tore her night in half.

One hand reached forward, seeking warmth, the other stayed to hold the frost.

The mirror laughed and took the darker hand, not flesh, but all that knew restraint.

Thus mercy fell like snow without a sky, and learned to walk alone.

Beware the shadow that believes itself a gift.

It will come calling not for the thief, but for the vessel that bears what was returned.

Two crowns share one breath, and only one was meant to bleed.

When the shadow seeks its maker, it will strike the heart that does not remember Winter.

Count not the season, count the debts.

For what is given in love will be reclaimed in silence.
