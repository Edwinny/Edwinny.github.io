# 🌸 Misthaven — Before the Frost

## The Blooming Plaza

The center of Misthaven — a circular plaza paved with white-and-gold cobblestones that always smelled faintly of lilac and honey. In its heart stood the Font of Mirth, a wide basin whose waters shimmered in every color of the dawn. The spring-fed fountain never ceased to flow, even when drought struck the countryside, and it was said that those who drank from it could not cry for a day.

Dancers, jesters, and musicians filled the plaza from sunrise until moonrise, the music of reed-pipes and laughter echoing through the marble streets.

<!-- **After the frost**: The Font is frozen mid-splash — its joyful waters locked in glass. Cracked masks lie half-buried in snowdrifts. -->

## The Dithyrambion

A sweeping amphitheater carved directly into the cliffside, designed to amplify the satyrs’ wild music. Every beam and arch was made from living wood coaxed into graceful spirals; the stage was said to pulse faintly with the rhythm of heartbeats when the revels grew most fevered.

At the height of Spring, the Hall’s performances could last for days — satyrs, dryads, and elves all swept into a single symphony of dance and delight.

<!-- **After the frost**: The Hall has grown quiet. Frost creeps along the living wood, turning it brittle. Where laughter once echoed, only the faint sound of cracking ice remains. -->

## The Petalways

A labyrinth of narrow alleys and bridges strung above the canal network — festooned with hanging flowers, silk banners, and floating lanterns. The canals themselves shimmered with illusion magic, painting ripples of gold and rose across the water. The Petalways were the city’s veins, where lovers, poets, and thieves alike made their lives.

<!-- **After the frost**: The canals are now rivers of frozen glass. The hanging gardens droop under the weight of ice, and the floating lanterns are dark, suspended midair as if time itself froze with them. -->

## The Glimmermarket

Misthaven’s famed open-air bazaar, where traders sold not goods, but experiences. For the right coin, one could buy the memory of a perfect kiss, a vial of laughter, or a single second of sunlight captured in crystal. Illusionists and charmweavers hawked their wares beside merchants from every corner of the Spring Court.

The market square pulsed with color — an ever-changing kaleidoscope of scents and songs.

<!-- **After the frost**: The stalls are deserted. The color-drunk sigils still glow faintly beneath the ice, giving the ground an eerie, submerged light. -->

## The Vineward

A vast garden district that climbed the cliffs surrounding the city — endless terraces of flowering vines, aromatic herbs, and songbirds. The Vineward was tended by satyrs and pixies who played as much as they worked. Its fruits were used to make the famed Dewwine of Misthaven, a sparkling drink said to “taste like laughter feels.”

<!-- **After the frost:** The terraces are bare, the vines turned to black lace under the frost. The birds are silent. The barrels of Dewwine sit cracked and frozen in their racks — a still toast to vanished joy. -->

## The Mirror Docks

Where river met mist — the edge of Misthaven’s domain. Here, great lily-shaped barges drifted in and out of the fog, guided by song rather than sight. The water was perfectly still, a silver mirror reflecting both sky and soul. It was said that if you stared into the water long enough, you might see not yourself, but the person you most wished to become.

<!-- **After the frost**: The mirror has shattered. The fog no longer dances — it broods. -->

## The Hall of the Pale Stag

The headquarters of the Hunters’ Association, protectors of the Far Reaches and keepers of balance between civilization and the wild. The Hall stood near the upper terraces of the city, overlooking the vine-clad cliffs and the silver rivers below.

Its grand façade was built from pale moonstone and veined marble, inlaid with motifs of antlers and flowing rivers. Tall banners of emerald and white fluttered from its spires, depicting the emblem of the Argent Stag — a horned beast wreathed in morning mist.

Within, trophies of great hunts adorned the walls: crystal-scaled drakes, antlers grown from living crystal, and the preserved wings of a slain frost sprite — a grim reminder of past winters overcome. But for all its splendor, the Hall was not a place of boastful glory; it was a place of discipline, of readiness.

The Hunters’ Association coordinated the protection of the Far Reaches — ensuring that roads remained safe, villages defended, and the balance of nature maintained. They worked as both wardens and scholars, as comfortable in the wilderness as in Misthaven’s courts.

In times of peace, their duties were ritual: culling overgrown beasts, guiding pilgrims through fae forests, and ensuring that the wild’s hunger never touched the city’s heart.

<!-- **After the frost**: The Hall burns by candlelight now, its outer terraces rimed with frost. Hunters crowd the war tables, arguing over maps covered in creeping blue stains. Reports speak of frost wyrms, ice-born hags, and armies of frost sprites sweeping the borders. Their proud banners hang stiff and frozen, weighed down by rime and exhaustion. The Argent Stag’s antlers glimmer with hoarfrost — as if even the symbol of their vigilance is struggling to endure. -->

## The Sylvan Mangal

At the edge of the Vineward lies Misthaven’s sacred heart — a sprawling mangal where silver-rooted trees grow from shallow water, their branches heavy with blossoms that never wilt. The air here was always soft and humming with life; will-o’-wisps drifted lazily among the roots, and the water mirrored the canopy above in endless fractal reflection.

This grove was ancient — said to predate the city itself — and served as a sacred meeting ground between the satyrs of Misthaven and the spirits of Spring. Here, druids, priests, and revelers came not to worship, but to celebrate the living bond between growth, joy, and the endless cycle of renewal.

It was also said that Azena herself once walked among these roots, laughing with the spirits and blessing the first vines that grew into the Vineward. Many festivals began and ended here — offerings of wine poured into the silver waters, songs echoing through the mangrove’s heart.

<!-- **After the frost**: The water is no longer soft but glass-hard, sealing the roots beneath a mirror of ice. The blossoms have turned to crystalline husks, their scent gone. The will-o’-wisps burn dim and cold, pale blue instead of gold. The druids have fallen silent, their rites turned to desperate pleas. The grove still hums — but now it is the hum of something waiting. Something vast and ancient beneath the ice, listening. -->
