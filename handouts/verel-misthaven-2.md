**Verel Thule, recorded by the Vineward Scriptorium**

Three were marked, though never together.

One was taken backward, where toys rot and names are eaten.

One was shown forward, where applause echoes without hands.

One was weighed down, roots pressed into living skin.

Each wound was chosen alone.

Each debt tallied by a different hand.

The glass was turned thrice, not once, and the sand never touched itself.

They will pass like strangers in the storm mistaking proximity for purpose.

When the reckoning comes, it will come in pieces.

Thus the coven keeps time: not with union, but with separation.
