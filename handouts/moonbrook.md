# 🏰 Moonbrook - Heart of the Spring Court

![Moonbrook](/assets/images/moonbrook.jpg)

Moonbrook is not a city that grows outward. It grows inward—layered glades, mirrored pools, and living architecture folding around ancient decisions. It is a place of beauty, ritual, and quiet authority, where memory and identity are treated as civic resources.

## Palace of Reflections

The seat of power of the Spring Court, where Azena and Inanna rule jointly.

The palace is grown rather than built, its halls formed from living crystalwood, silverleaf, and still water. Every surface reflects something - sometimes the viewer, sometimes something older.

Subtle enchantments ensure that lies spoken here echo faintly, as if reality itself hesitates to accept them.

## The Bloomward

Moonbrook's elite district, home to nobles, high-ranking fey, celebrated artists, and those favoured by the court.

Gardens here are curated to appear effortless, though each bloom is meticulously shaped. Status is displayed through vitality, not excess—rare blossoms, impossible seasons, controlled wildness. To live in the Bloomward is to be visibly close to Spring's favour.

Many who reside here privately fear losing relevance more than death.

## The Mirror Marches

A reflective promenade winding through the Bloomward, following Moonbrook's most pristine pools.

This quiet pilgrimage path leads to a small shrine where statues reveal hidden memories of those who stand before them—sometimes from this life, sometimes from another their soul once touched. The visions are fragmentary and symbolic, never whole truths.

Favoured by Azena, the Marches resonate with fractured identity and shared souls. Courtly etiquette strongly discourages visiting too often.

## Shrine of Stillness

A secluded hollow containing eight faceless statues; elf, human, gnome, dragonborn, satyr, fairy, giant, nymph - arrayed around a pool of silvery, mercury-like water.

Channels flow from the central pool to the base of each statue, equal in measure. The water reflects not the present, but the unmoving self: who one is when stripped of title, memory, and desire.

Azena is known to linger here alone. No prayers are spoken aloud.

## Grove of Silent Echoes (Destroyed)

Once a public sacred space where Moonbrook's people communed with memory, grief, and renewal.

The grove amplified emotional resonance—joy, mourning, longing—allowing feelings to be acknowledged and released. Its destruction is still felt across the city, particularly among those without access to the Bloomward's controlled rituals.

Its absence has created a civic wound that has not healed.

## The Verdant Chorus (Grand Stadium of Moonbrook)

A vast living amphitheatre grown into a natural bowl of the city, its tiered seating formed from woven boughs and flowering stone.

The Chorus hosts grand sporting events, ritual competitions, and the Idol Awards, where cultural legends of the Spring Court are crowned. Sound carries unnaturally well here—applause can feel like wind, and silence like judgment.

Beneath the celebration lies something older: the structure resonates faintly with sacrifice and spectacle, hinting that it once served more dangerous rites.
