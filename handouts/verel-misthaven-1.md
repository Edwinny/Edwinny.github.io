> Fragment I — Untitled, catalogued as “Winter Marginalia”

The bell rang before it was forged

Snow remembers hands that never touched it

Three walk as one but count themselves wrong

The middle shadow speaks sideways

When the door learned it was a wall

The wall learned hunger

Do not ask which came first

The answer is late and early and bleeding

I wrote this tomorrow

I forgot it yesterday
