# 🌙 The Silver Sparks

A nimble gang of child thieves, messengers, and illusionists who haunt the alleys and canal bridges of Emberwind. The Silver Sparks operate under the philosophy that “a flicker of light distracts the eye before the hand takes the purse.” They rely as much on cleverness and charm as on stealth.

Their hideout is an abandoned glassblower’s workshop in the outskirts of the smouldering district, filled with shattered mirrors, hanging charms, and the faint glow of magical embers that never fully die.

## ⚙️ Key NPCs

### Flicker

Gang Leader (early 30s)

A once-orphaned boy who grew up on the streets and never forgot what it meant to be small and invisible. Now the gang’s “captain,” Flicker has turned survival into an art.

- Appearance: Wiry, quick, with soot-darkened skin and a smile too sharp to be friendly. His eyes shimmer faintly — rumored to be from a magical lantern explosion years ago.
- Personality: Charismatic, teasing, protective of his crew. He plays the fool to keep enemies guessing but is deeply calculating underneath.
- Motive: Keeps the Silver Sparks alive not for riches, but because “the world burns bright enough without throwing its children to the flames.”

### Nessa (aka Tink)

The Tinkerer

A scrappy half-gnome girl who handles all the gang’s “toys” — enchanted trinkets, smoke bombs, and pocket illusions.

- Appearance: Hair tied into wild braids, hands always stained with soot and glitter. Goggles too big for her face.
- Personality: Excitable, nervous talker who refers to her inventions as “friends.” She keeps a handmade puppet that she swears helps her think.
- Quirk: Constantly muttering half-finished rhymes while working.
- Motive: Dreams of one day becoming a legitimate artificer in Emberwind’s famed forges — though she’s too scared to leave the gang.

### Miri the Mirror Rat

Scout and Whisper

![miri](/assets/images/miri.png)

A tiny elven girl who moves through Emberwind’s reflections — literally. Some say she was blessed (or cursed) by the city’s magic itself.

- Appearance: Pale as moonlight, hair slicked silver, always barefoot. Her voice echoes faintly, as though she’s speaking from another room.
- Personality: Shy and strange. She speaks in riddles or half-sentences, sometimes finishing other people’s thoughts.
- Motive: Miri doesn’t remember where she came from, only that the reflections “feel like home.” Flicker treats her like a younger sister.
