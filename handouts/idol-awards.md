# The Idol Awards

The Idol Awards are held every year in Moonbrook and are a progressive elimination tournament. Qualifiers are open and held all over the Spring Court to identify 5 finalists which compete in Moonbrook in the tournament-proper.

The openening ceremony is held on The Day of First Bloom (New Years Day effectively) and the tournament runs for the first week of the New Year.

Huntrix (Trixie) are the reigning champions, winning the past 5 Idol Awards back-to-back

## Qualifiers

Qualifiers are held in almost every major town and city throughout the Spring Court, and involve performing in front of an official moderator of the Idol Awards. All entrants' performances are then collated and ranked on a mix of musical talent, showmanship & choreography. The top 5 are then invited to the Finals in Moonbrook.

The winner of the previous year are automatically invited to the Finals to defend their title

## Voting

The tournament features a judges panel grading everyones performance on the same metrics used in the qualifiers, however; the judge's vote only accounts for 60% of the total points available. 20% of the vote is given by the audience in the stadium, making tickets a hot commodity each year. The final 20% is awarded by the finalists themselves, picking their favourites amongst their competition.

## Prize

Aside from the fame brought from winning; there is a prize-pool of 1000gp along with exclusive usage rights of the Mandeville Pavilion inside The Bloomward for one year (your very own digs with the elite of Moonbrook)
