# The Summer Court

The Summer Court is a place of beauty, warmth, abundance and pleasure. The archfey of this court are focused first on enjoying themselves. Beauty, wit and charm are the most important aspects for the Summer Archfey.

Mortals generally aren’t accepted in the Summer Court, except as trophies. A beautiful mortal or an exceptional musician may be invited (or kidnapped) to a court and briefly doted upon until they become bored and move onto the next thing at which point the mortal is hopefully returned to the mortal world but more often simply abandoned.

Annoying a Summer Archfey is a bad idea as if they tire of someone’s company they will likely transform them into something more entertaining.

Major archfey of this court include:

Ruler: **Titania - The Maiden of Summer**

Secondary: **Oberon - The Lord of the Green Wood**
