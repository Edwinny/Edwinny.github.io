# 🌱 A new life - A new hope?

The Ashen Gardens lie hushed, their beds of gray dust whispering in the breeze like the remnants of forgotten fires. At the center, the great basin of black volcanic glass waits, its cracks jagged and lifeless — a wound carved into the city’s heart during the Hollow War. Around you, a crowd of Emberwind’s people watch in reverent silence, their firelit eyes reflecting both doubt and fragile hope.

Rolls

A child-sized shadow darts between robes and cloaks, graceful as a fish through water. A small hand dips into a noble’s pocket, another into a merchant’s satchel. For a moment, the crowd’s shimmer catches her — a pale, barefoot girl, hair like silver glass, eyes gleaming with mischief and light.

As you place the seed into the basin, the air stills. The scroll shimmers in your hands, its runes flickering with emerald light, and when you speak the final word, the parchment crumbles to dust — absorbed into the seed itself.

At first, nothing. Then — a tremor, a heartbeat beneath the stone.

With a sound like cracking thunder, roots burst outward, threading through the volcanic glass as though it were soft clay. Green light pours from the fissures, spilling across the gardens, turning ash to soil. The seedling erupts upward, its trunk swelling and twisting, branches unfurling like wings.

In moments, the sapling becomes a colossus — a banyan tree of impossible scale, its crown already half the height of the Crimson Spire. Roots descend in curtains, weaving a living cathedral of verdant wood, glowing faintly with starlight caught between its leaves.

The people gasp. For the first time in living memory, the scar of the Hollow War is not only remembered — it is healed. The Ashen Gardens are no longer a grave, but a sanctuary.

And in that silence after the miracle, you realize: this tree is not just alive. It is watching.
