# üåë First Meeting with an unusual sort

The streets of Emberwind buzz with life ‚Äî fire-dancers on corners, merchants hawking mirrors and charms, the tang of smoke and spice in the air. Yet amid the clamor, you hear a **strange voice** rise above it all.

In the shadow of a weathered fountain, a **ragged figure** sits cross-legged upon a crate. Their cloak is patched with scraps of silver cloth, their hair an untamed tangle streaked with gray-white. Before them, a shallow bronze bowl filled with water trembles, though no hand touches it.

The figure cackles suddenly, sending a nearby child scurrying.

> ‚ÄúAhh! They walk, they _walk_ ‚Äî threads unspooled, roots untethered! Do you not hear it? Do you not feel it? The world _splits itself_ ragged with longing!‚Äù

The crowd avoids them with the wary sidelong glances reserved for lunatics. But as you draw closer, the figure‚Äôs eyes snap to yours. **Mercury pools of silver** bore into you ‚Äî piercing, unsettling, too sharp to be madness.

They jab a crooked finger in your direction.

> ‚ÄúYou! Yes, you. The ones who carry seeds in their shadow and storms in their marrow. You‚Äôve broken things already, haven‚Äôt you? Mm, yes‚Ä¶ the silence tastes different now. Haaah! Azena will not be pleased.‚Äù

Their laugh rings out like cracked glass, but it‚Äôs followed by a sudden, lucid whisper as you lean in:

> ‚ÄúAshes can sprout if watered with blood. Embers can birth forests, if you dare to plant them. But tell me‚Ä¶ when the cold claws down from the hollow sky, will you still believe in blooming?‚Äù

Then, as quickly as the moment came, the figure slaps the bowl, sending the water spilling into the dirt. They resume muttering nonsense to themselves, rocking back and forth like any ordinary mad soothsayer.

Yet the echo of their words hangs heavy.
Something about this **mercury-eyed prophet** feels‚Ä¶ older than the city itself.
