## 🌪️ **The Argent Flame of Emberwind**

The leader of Emberwind is known to mortals as **Vaelithar the Argent Flame**, though Azena calls them only _Vaelith_, with the easy familiarity of an old comrade.

Mercury dragons are rare even among their kind, creatures of quicksilver mind and form, whose scales ripple like living mirrors. Vaelithar is no exception: in dragon-shape, their body shimmers like molten metal poured into the sky, and even in humanoid guise their silver hair seems fluid, forever catching the light.

## ⚔️ **Bond with Azena**

- During the **Hollow War**, when the Summer and Winter Courts bled the Feywild white, Vaelithar and Azena stood side by side.
- Azena was then a general, not yet a queen, wielding her wits and her unyielding heart. Vaelithar was her shield and her fire, scouring armies with silver flame.
- Together, they were called the **“Dawn and the Argent Flame.”**
- Their friendship was forged not just in battle, but in **ideals**: both believed that a new order must rise from the ruin of the old courts, one that valued renewal, harmony, and the weaving together of broken things.

## 🔮 **Personality and Presence**

- Vaelithar is playful, mercurial, and unpredictable — but behind the whimsy lies a **deep well of wisdom and melancholy**.
- They speak in riddles or metaphors, often describing present struggles in terms of **reflections, mirrors, and flowing rivers**.
- They adore mortals for their short-lived brilliance, and are known to slip into Emberwind’s streets disguised as a minstrel, storyteller, or eccentric tinkerer.
- Yet, when roused, their wrath is said to shine brighter than molten silver, leaving landscapes scorched and gleaming like glass.

## 🌸 **Why Emberwind?**

- The city itself was raised upon the ashes of the Hollow War, its crimson tower a scar and a monument. Vaelithar swore to guard it as a sanctuary for dreamers, artisans, and wanderers.
- To this day, Emberwind thrives on **artistry, invention, and freedom**, mirroring Vaelithar’s mercurial nature. It is a city of fire and reflection, where the air hums with possibility.

## 🎭 **Hooks for Play**

- Vaelithar could serve as **patron, foil, or uneasy ally**. Their chaotic nature means they may support the party one day and test them the next.
- Their friendship with Azena ensures political weight — if Vaelithar speaks, even the Verdant Throne must listen.
- They may also carry **memories of the Hollow War** that even Azena has set aside, stories that could reshape how the party views the past — and what’s coming.
