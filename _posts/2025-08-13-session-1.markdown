## ðŸ”¥Â A Grove Destroyed; A City in MourningÂ ðŸ”¥

The journey back feels longer than the road that brought you to the Grove.

The soft chiming of wind-bells is gone. The air hangs heavy, thick with a faint, metallic tasteâ€”like rain that never comes.

When Moonbrookâ€™s gates crest into view, the change is immediate.

The cityâ€™s famed mirrored canals are dull, their surfaces flat and lifeless without the magical shimmer that once danced across them. The crystalline lanterns that lined every street now hang dark and cold, their silver chains swaying in the breeze.

Half-built pavilions for the Spring Faire stand abandonedâ€”their colors muted without the reflected light. Stalls stand shuttered, baskets of early blossom petals gone limp and brown. A banner for the upcoming Tourney of Petals has collapsed into the canal, its once-gilded lettering bleeding into the water.

And at the cityâ€™s heart, the Palace of Reflections loomsâ€”no longer a radiant beacon, but a vast shadow in the dim. The great mirrored tower, which once caught the dawn and scattered it across the city like spilled stars, is black.

The people move like wraiths through the streets, speaking in hushed tones. Their faces, once bright with the seasonâ€™s promise, now carry the same expression: they are looking for a light that is no longer there.

Somewhere in the distance, a bell tollsâ€”not in celebration, but in mourning.

## Your mission from Azena

- Travel to Emberwind and plant the seeds of the Banyan. Its roots will bind to the Honmoon bringing some power back to Moonbrook
- Continue to Misthaven to investigate Debuccyâ€™s disappearance and the Mangal growing there. Debuccy must be found, and if the blight has formed there, we have to know more about it
