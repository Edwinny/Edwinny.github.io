## ðŸŒ¸Â Introduction to Moonbrook: The City of ReflectionsÂ ðŸŒ¸

Beneath twin moons that shimmer like mirrored pearls in a twilight sky, the city ofÂ **Moonbrook**Â rises in elegance and enchantment. Nestled in a glimmering vale of eternal spring, where the trees bloom in crystalline hues and the rivers sing songs of forgotten dreams, Moonbrook is a place of beauty, illusion, and power.

Known as theÂ **City of Reflections**, Moonbrook is the jewel of theÂ **Spring Court**, a nexus where light bends, truth dances in riddles, and even the air carries whispers of forgotten laughter. The cityâ€™s famed mirrored canals, glass-arched bridges, and illusion-drenched towers are more than just artificeâ€”they are echoes of memory and magic, as real and unreal as the Feywild itself.

Moonbrook is ruled in tandem by the radiantÂ **Queen Inanna**, a seelie fey of warmth and insight, and the enigmaticÂ **Lady Azena**, a being of deep magic and unreadable grace. Together, they guide the city through the ever-shifting tides of Feywild politics, glamours, and power.

But not all is at peace in the city of mirrors.

AÂ **disturbance has rippled through the magic**Â that flows from one of Moonbrookâ€™s most sacred sitesâ€”**the [[Grove of Silent Echoes]]**. Now, the grove lies cloaked in unnatural silence, its waters dulled, its visions murky, and its guardian spirits missing. The city's reflections have begun to fracture. Dreams go unremembered. Illusions refuse to hold.

And so, at the bidding of Moonbrookâ€™s dual sovereigns,Â **you are summoned**â€”whether by duty, curiosity, or the inscrutable will of the Feywild itself. Your path begins not with a battle, but a question:

**What happens when the reflection no longer matches the world it once mirrored?**

Welcome to Moonbrook, brave wanderers. Step carefullyâ€”here,Â **even the truth wears a mask.**
