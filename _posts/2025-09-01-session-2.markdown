## ðŸŒ™ Shrine of Stillness

The shrine rests in a secluded hollow of Moonbrook, where the bustle of canals and palaces fades into a hush so complete that even birdsong seems unwilling to intrude.

At its center lies a wide, shallow pool of silvery water, perfectly still, its surface reflecting the sky above with uncanny clarity. Around the pool stand eight statues, each carved in the likeness of one of the major mortal races â€” elf, human, dwarf, halfling, gnome, dragonborn, half-orc, and tiefling. Their figures are graceful, almost lifelike, yet every face is left blank and smooth, as though refusing to claim identity or self.

From the central pool, slender channels of water trickle outward, one to each statueâ€™s feet, where the rivulets gather in small basins before vanishing into the stone. The faint sound of running water is the only voice here, a soft counterpoint to the shrineâ€™s silence.

It is said the waters show more than reflections â€” that if you stare long enough, you may glimpse what lies within, or what has been lost. Many come here to meditate, to pray, or to seek release from burdens they cannot speak aloud.

This place is also favored by Azena, one of Moonbrookâ€™s sovereigns. Those who have glimpsed her here tell of a queen sitting barefoot at the poolâ€™s edge, gazing into the waters for hours, her reflection rippling like a second self.

The shrine, generally, holds no priest, no offerings, and no doctrine. Only silence, reflection, and the quiet truth that in stillness, all souls are the same.

## ðŸŒ™Â Departing Moonbrook - A New Hope ðŸŒ™

As you depart Moonbrook, the city behind you feels hushed and hollow.

Once-bright lanterns now hang dark above canals of black, glassy water. Banners meant for the Spring Faire flutter in tatters, abandoned, as if even the seasons themselves have turned away. The air carries the faint scent of wax and wilted flowers.

The road winds outward, past empty squares and silent shrines, until the towers of Moonbrook fade into shadow. The silence of the city gives way to the whisper of reeds, and the soft thrum of insects hidden in the mist.

The journey feels strange. Like days of distance being covered in a mere heartbeat. The land undulates under your feet as the Feywild itself warps to the will of an unseen power. Slowly, you notice the land change. Warmth begins to seep up from the ground. The mists thin into shimmering heat, and the soft greens shift into bronze and amber. Fireflies streak through the air like sparks, and the wind carries with it the smell of woodsmoke and spice.

At last, cresting a ridge, you see Emberwind: a city alive with firelight and motion. Brass-tiled roofs shimmer in the heat, crimson banners dance in the air, and lanterns burn with steady flames that need no oil. Music drifts faintly on the wind, carried with the restless pulse of the city itself.

## Your mission from Azena - Reminder

- Travel to Emberwind and plant the seeds of the Banyan. Its roots will bind to the Honmoon bringing some power back to Moonbrook
- Continue to Misthaven to investigate Debuccyâ€™s disappearance and the Mangal growing there. Debuccy must be found, and if the blight has formed there, we have to know more about it
- If you discover Hades; kill or contain. He is an enemy of the Spring Court
